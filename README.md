# web_socket

A Gleam project for me to learn Gleam ‚≠ê

For the time being, this is an attempt at rewriting
[`Mint.WebSocket.Frame`](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/mint_web_socket/blob/93a341f60510ce63fd349ce377d20c25804e6bbe/lib/mint/web_socket/frame.ex)
in Gleam, so I can learn the basics of Gleam and the stdlib.
